        Abeliophyllum (White Forsythia, or Korean Abelialeaf) is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in the olive
        family,
        Oleaceae. It consists of one species, Abeliophyllum distichum Nakai, endemic to Korea, where it is
        endangered in
        the
        wild, occurring at only seven sites. It is related to Forsythia, but differs in having white, not yellow,
        flowers.
